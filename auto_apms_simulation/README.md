# auto_apms_simulation

This package utilizes [pyrobosim](https://github.com/sea-bass/pyrobosim).
Before running the simulation application, you must manually install all packages listed in `requirements.txt`, since some packages aren't available with `rosdep`.

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
