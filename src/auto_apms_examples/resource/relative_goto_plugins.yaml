# A node config file may have multiple root nodes specifying a ROS2 package to load plugins from.
# The child of each root node is a list of plugin target names to load.
# The plugin target name node must also have a child. This child is either the default port name
# of the node (in case of a ROS2 node plugin) or empty (in case of a standard behavior tree node plugin).
#
# package_name1:
#   standard_plugin_key:
#   ros2_plugin_key: "node_default_port_name"
# package_name2:
#   ros2_plugin_key: "node_default_port_name"
#
# NOTE:
# The ROS2 namespacing concept (https://design.ros2.org/articles/topic_and_service_names.html)
# applies to node_default_port_name. That is, you can specify both relative and absolute names.
