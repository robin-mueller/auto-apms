/**
 * @ingroup auto_apms_behavior_tree
 * @brief Class containing behavior tree resource data
 *
 * Behavior tree resources are registered by calling the CMake macro `auto_apms_behavior_tree_declare_trees` in the
 * CMakeLists.txt of a package. They can be discovered once the corresponding package has been installed to the ROS 2
 * workspace.
 *
 * The user may refer to a specific resource using an identity string that may contain the tokens `<package_name>`,
 * `<tree_file_stem>` and `<tree_name>` separated by `::` in that order. Depending on the number of registered
 * resources, it might be convenient to use shorter, less precise signatures. Additionally, if the delimiter `::` is not
 * present, the string is assumed to be the stem of a behavior tree file `<tree_file_stem>`. All possible identity
 * strings are listed below:
 *
 * - `<package_name>::<tree_file_stem>::<tree_name>`
 *
 *   Fully qualified identity string of a specific behavior tree.
 *
 * - `::<tree_file_stem>::<tree_name>`
 *
 *   Try to find the resource by searching for a tree with name `<tree_name>` in a file with stem `<tree_file_stem>`
 *   considering all packages.
 *
 * - `<package_name>::::<tree_name>`
 *
 *   Try to find a tree with name `<tree_name>` within the resources registered by `<package_name>`.
 *
 * - `::::<tree_name>`
 *
 *   Try to find the resource by searching for a tree with name `<tree_name>` considering all packages.
 *
 * - `<package_name>::<tree_file_stem>::`
 *
 *   Try to find a file with stem `<tree_file_stem>` within the resources registered by `<package_name>`.
 *
 * - `::<tree_file_stem>::` or `<tree_file_stem>`
 *
 *   Try to find the resource by searching for a file with stem `<tree_file_stem>` considering all packages. Here you
 *   may conveniently omit the `::` delimiter, since this is the most common way for searching for a resource.
 *
 * @note The delimiter `::` must be kept when tokens are omitted, except when searching for resources using only the
 * file stem.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * Given the user has specified a behavior tree named `MyBehaviorTree` inside the XML file `config/my_tree_file.xml`,
 * the CMake macro `auto_apms_behavior_tree_declare_trees` must be called in the CMakeLists.txt of the parent package
 * (for example `my_package`) like this:
 *
 * ```cmake
 * auto_apms_behavior_tree_declare_trees(
 *     "config/my_tree_file.xml"
 * )
 * ```
 *
 * The macro automatically parses the given files and detects the names of the trees inside. In the C++ source code, one
 * may use this resource, after the parent package `my_package` has been installed, like this:
 *
 * ```cpp
 * #include "auto_apms_behavior_tree_core/tree/tree_resource.hpp"
 *
 * using namespace auto_apms_behavior_tree;
 *
 * // For example, use the fully qualified tree resource identity signature
 * const std::string identity_string = "my_package::my_behavior_tree::MyTreeName";
 *
 * // You may use the proxy class for a tree resource identity
 * core::TreeResourceIdentity identity(identity_string);
 * core::TreeResource resource(identity);
 *
 * // Or instantiate the resource object directly from the corresponding identity string
 * core::TreeResource resource(identity_string);
 *
 * // The resource object may for example be used with TreeDocument
 * core::TreeDocument doc;
 * doc.mergeResource(resource);  // Add "MyTreeName" to the document
 *
 * // This also works, so creating a resource object is not strictly necessary
 * doc.mergeResource(identity_string)
 *
 * // The simplest approach is this
 * doc.mergeResource("my_package::my_behavior_tree::MyTreeName");
 * ```
 *
