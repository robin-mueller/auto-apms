/**
 * @ingroup auto_apms_behavior_tree
 * @brief Document Object Model (DOM) for the behavior tree XML schema. This class offers a programmatic approach for
 * building behavior trees and stores the registration data of all associated nodes.
 *
 * A single tree document may contain multiple behavior trees (represented by TreeElement). Each behavior tree may
 * contain an arbitrary amount of tree nodes (represented by NodeElement). There are various different types of nodes.
 * For each one of the [standard
 * nodes](https://robin-mueller.github.io/auto-apms-guide/reference/behavior-tree-nodes),
 * there is a model available under the `auto_apms_behavior_tree::model` namespace. Refer to the
 * [BehaviorTree.CPP](https://www.behaviortree.dev/docs/learn-the-basics/BT_basics) website for more infos on the basic
 * concepts of behavior trees used in this implementation.
 *
 * A TreeDocument instance must be kept alive for as long as its behavior trees are accessed in any way. When a document
 * instance is destroyed, the memory of the associated behavior trees is deleted. Hence, a TreeDocument acts the same as
 * a `tinyxml2::XMLDocument`.
 *
 * Copy assignment is not supported to enforce the builder design pattern. To copy certain
 * behavior trees from one document to another, the user must explicitly invoke TreeDocument::mergeTreeDocument of
 * another document instance.
 *
 * The XML schema of a tree document is defined [here](https://www.behaviortree.dev/docs/learn-the-basics/xml_format)
 * and looks similar to this:
 *
 * ```xml
 * <root BTCPP_format="4" main_tree_to_execute="RootTree">
 *   <!-- Each TreeDocument may have zero or more behavior tree elements -->
 *   <BehaviorTree ID="RootTree">
 *     <!-- Each behavior tree element has exactly one child. This child may again have zero or more children -->
 *   </BehaviorTree>
 *   <BehaviorTree ID="AnotherTree">
 *     <!-- ... -->
 *   </BehaviorTree>
 * </root>
 * ```
 *
 * @note A tree document always has a single root element that holds the format version and the name of the root tree
 * acting as an entry point for execution.
 *
 * The content of the document can be configured as desired using its member functions. For example like this:
 *
 *  ```cpp
 * #include "auto_apms_behavior_tree_core/tree/tree_document.hpp"
 *
 * // Bring the behavior tree API into scope.
 * using namespace auto_apms_behavior_tree;
 *
 * // Initially, the document is created. It must be kept alive throughout this scope.
 * core::TreeDocument doc;
 *
 * // You may hold on to the returned tree and node elements (they're only valid as long as the document is).
 * core::TreeDocument::TreeElement root_tree = doc.newTree("RootTree");
 * core::TreeDocument::NodeElement sequence = root_tree.insertNode("Sequence");
 * // You may add more nodes to the sequence node created above.
 * // ...
 *
 * // Method chaining is supported as well.
 * doc.newTree("AnotherTree").insertNode("AlwaysSuccess");
 * // "AnotherTree" has an action node as first child. Action nodes act as tree leaves, meaning they cannot have
 * // children themselves.
 * ```
 *
 * Alternatively (and preferably), the user may profit from static type validation and more convenience methods by
 * incorporating node models as template arguments:
 *
 * ```cpp
 * #include "auto_apms_behavior_tree_core/tree/tree_document.hpp"
 * #include "auto_apms_behavior_tree/behavior_tree_nodes.hpp"  // This includes the node models
 *
 * // Bring the behavior tree API into scope.
 * using namespace auto_apms_behavior_tree;
 *
 * // Initially, the document is created. It must be kept alive throughout this scope.
 * core::TreeDocument doc;
 *
 * // You may hold on to the returned tree and node elements (they're only valid as long as the document is).
 * core::TreeDocument::TreeElement root_tree = doc.newTree("RootTree");
 * model::Sequence sequence = root_tree.insertNode<model::Sequence>();
 * // You may add more nodes to the sequence node created above.
 * // ...
 *
 * // Method chaining is supported as well.
 * doc.newTree("AnotherTree").insertNode<model::AlwaysSuccess>();
 * // "AnotherTree" has an action node as first child. Action nodes act as tree leaves, meaning they cannot have
 * // children themselves. This is enforced by the compiler when using a node model as a template argument.
 * ```
 * The former approach can be achieved using the API offered by the `auto_apms_behavior_tree_core` package, while the
 * latter requires to build and link against the `%auto_apms_behavior_tree` package, since the node models are generated
 * automatically by that package.
