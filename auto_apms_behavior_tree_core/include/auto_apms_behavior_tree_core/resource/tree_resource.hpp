   * @brief Find a behavior tree resource using an identity string.
   *
   * To uniquely identify the resource, the @p identity string may contain the
   * `<package_name>`, the `<tree_file_stem>` and the `<tree_name>` seperated by `::` in that order. Depending on the
   * registered resources, it might be convenient to use shorter, less precise signatures. Additionally, if the
   * delimiter `::` is not present, it's assumed that the string contains the stem of a behavior tree file
   * `<tree_file_stem>`. All possible identity strings are listed below:
   *
   * - `<package_name>::<tree_file_stem>::<tree_name>`
   *
   *   Fully qualified identity string of a specific behavior tree.
   *
   * - `::<tree_file_stem>::<tree_name>`
   *
   *   Try to find the resource by searching for a tree with name `<tree_name>` in a file with stem `<tree_file_stem>`
   *   considering all packages.
   *
   * - `<package_name>::::<tree_name>`
   *
   *   Try to find a tree with name `<tree_name>` within the resources registered by `<package_name>`.
   *
   * - `::::<tree_name>`
   *
   *   Try to find the resource by searching for a tree with name `<tree_name>` considering all packages.
   *
   * - `<package_name>::<tree_file_stem>::`
   *
   *   Try to find a file with stem `<tree_file_stem>` within the resources registered by `<package_name>`.
   *
   * - `::<tree_file_stem>::` or `<tree_file_stem>`
   *
   *   Try to find the resource by searching for a file with stem `<tree_file_stem>` considering all packages. Here you
   *   may conveniently omit the `::` delimiter, since this is the most common way for searching for a resource.
   *
   * @note The delimiter `::` must be kept when tokens are omitted, except when searching for resources using only the
   * file stem.
   *
   * @param identity Identity string with formatting compliant to the signatures above.
   * @return Corresponding TreeResource object.
   * @throws auto_apms_util::exceptions::ResourceIdentityFormatError if the identity string has wrong format.
   * @throws auto_apms_util::exceptions::ResourceError if the resource cannot be found using the given
   * identity string.
