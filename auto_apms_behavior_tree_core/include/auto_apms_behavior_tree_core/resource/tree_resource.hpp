   * registered resources, it might be possible to use shorter, less precise signatures. All possible identity strings

   *   Fully qualified identity string of a behavior tree resource.
   *
   * - `<tree_file_stem>::<tree_name>::`
   *
   *   Try to find the resource by searching for a tree with name `<tree_name>` in a file with stem `<tree_file_stem>`
   * considering all packages.
   *
   * - `<tree_file_stem>::::`
   *
   *   Try to find the resource by searching for a file with stem `<tree_file_stem>` considering all packages.
   *
   * - `::<tree_name>::`
   *
   *   Try to find the resource by searching for a tree with name `<tree_name>` considering all packages.
   *
   * @note The delimiter `::` must be kept when tokens are omitted.
   *
   * @param identity Identity string with formatting compliant to the signatures above.
   * @return Corresponding TreeResource object.
   * @throws exceptions::ResourceIdentityFormatError if the identity string has wrong format.
   * @throws auto_apms_util::exceptions::ResourceError if the resource cannot be found using the given
   * identity string.
