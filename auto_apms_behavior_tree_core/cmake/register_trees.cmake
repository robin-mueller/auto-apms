# Register behavior trees with the package's resources.
#
# This macro makes behavior trees available to the ROS 2 workspace by
# exposing the corresponding XML and node manifest files as ament_index
# resources.

# :param ARGN: Behavior tree XML files to be added to this package's resources.
# :type ARGN: list of files
# :param NODE_MANIFEST: One or more relative paths or resource identities of existing node manifests.
#   If specified, behavior tree nodes associated with this manifest can be
#   loaded automatically and are available for every tree under ARGN.
# :type NODE_MANIFEST: list of strings
# :param MARK_AS_INTERNAL: If this option is set, the trees are assigned a special category which indicates that the
#    behavior is intended for internal use only.
