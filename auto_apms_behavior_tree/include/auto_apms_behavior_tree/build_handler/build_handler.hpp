/**
 * @ingroup auto_apms_behavior_tree
 * @brief Base class for plugins that implement patterns for creating behavior trees using a standardized interface.
 *
 * Inheriting classes must implement TreeBuildHandler::buildTree. Additionally, the user is given the possibility to
 * define specific rules for when to accept a request and what to do when one arrives. This can be achieved by
 * overriding TreeBuildHandler::setBuildRequest. By default, all requests are accepted and the arguments of the build
 * request are ignored.
 *
 * A tree build handler allows TreeExecutorNode to create a behavior tree at runtime when an execution
 * request is received. The user may change the the way how a behavior tree is created by simply switching to the
 * desired build handler implementation. To make those implementations available at runtime, the user must register them
 * using the CMake macro `auto_apms_behavior_tree_declare_build_handlers` in the CMakeLists.txt of the parent package.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * Behavior tree build handler plugins are created like this:
 *
 * ```cpp
 * // src/my_build_handler.cpp
 *
 * #include "auto_apms_behavior_tree/build_handler.hpp"
 *
 * namespace my_namespace
 * {
 *
 * class MyCustomBuildHandler : public auto_apms_behavior_tree::TreeBuildHandler
 * {
 * public:
 *   using TreeBuildHandler::TreeBuildHandler;
 *
 *   bool setBuildRequest(const std::string & build_request,
 *                        const std::string & entrypoint,
 *                        const NodeManifest & node_manifest) override final
 *   {
 *     // Do something when a build request arrives. If this isn't overridden,
 *     // all requests are accepted regardless of the arguments given above.
 *
 *     // ...
 *
 *     // Returning true means accepting the request, false means rejecting it
 *     return true;
 *   }
 *
 *   TreeDocument::TreeElement buildTree(TreeDocument & doc,
 *                                       TreeBlackboard & bb) override final
 *   {
 *     // Configure the behavior tree
 *     TreeDocument::TreeElement tree = doc.newTree("MyTreeName");
 *
 *     // ...
 *
 *     // The returned tree element must point to a behavior tree within doc
 *     // and will be used as the root tree.
 *     return tree;
 *   }
 * };
 *
 * }  // namespace my_namespace
 *
 * // Make sure the plugin class is discoverable
 * AUTO_APMS_BEHAVIOR_TREE_DECLARE_BUILD_HANDLER(my_namespace::MyCustomBuildHandler)
 * ```
 *
 * Given this implementation, the CMake macro `auto_apms_behavior_tree_declare_build_handlers` must be called in the
 * CMakeLists.txt of the parent package like this:
 *
 * ```cmake
 * find_package(ament_cmake REQUIRED)
 * find_package(auto_apms_behavior_tree REQUIRED)
 *
 * # Create a shared library
 * add_library(my_build_handler_library_target SHARED
 *     "src/my_build_handler.cpp"  # Add the source file
 * )
 * ament_target_dependencies(my_build_handler_library_target
 *     auto_apms_behavior_tree  # The library must link against auto_apms_behavior_tree
 * )
 *
 * # Add the plugin to this package's ament_index resources
 * auto_apms_behavior_tree_declare_build_handlers(my_build_handler_library_target
 *     "my_namespace::MyCustomBuildHandler"
 * )
 *
 * # Install the shared library to the standard directory
 * install(
 *     TARGETS
 *     my_build_handler_library_target
 *     LIBRARY DESTINATION lib
 *     ARCHIVE DESTINATION lib
 *     RUNTIME DESTINATION bin
 * )
 *
 * ament_package()
 * ```
 *
 * Once the parent package has been installed, the build handler plugin may be loaded using TreeBuildHandlerLoader. With
 * a behavior tree executor node, the user may simply set its parameter called `build_handler` to
 * "my_namespace::MyCustomBuildHandler" (the fully qualified class name). All build requests that the node receives from
 * this point on are forwarded to this specific build handler implementation.
